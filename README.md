# `pymol-movie`

## Usage

```commandline
pip3 install .
python3 -m pymol_movie [<path_to_yaml>]
```

or

```commandline
docker build -t [<tag>] .
docker run [<tag>] [<path_to_yaml>]
```

## Creating Config .yaml

To create a movie a .yaml configuration file is used. The file describes the objects, produce
settings and individual scenes of the pymol movie.

### Top level

|           |                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `setup`   | Movie setup configuration      |
| `scenes`  | A list of scenes               |
| `produce` | Movie production configuration |

---

### setup

|           |                         |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| `objects` | A list of pymol objects |

A sample setup:

```yaml
setup:
  objects:
    - ...
```

#### setup:objects

|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`      | Pymol editor name for object. This name is also used to refer to this object in the .yaml configuration.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `directory` | Filepath to directory containing all states of the object. Recommended to use absolute file path as relative filepath depends on the working direction of the script rather than location of the .yaml. To order the states files must be labeled by number 1,2,3... |
| `states`    | The number of states to load from the object directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

A sample object:

```yaml
setup:
  objects:
    - name: isaac
      directory: ./example_trajectories/simple_translate
      states: 200
```

### scenes

In PyMol scenes are used to store view, all object activity information, all atom-wise visibility,
color, representations and the global frame index. PyMol will then automatically interpolate between
those scenes that results in the desired smooth transitions. https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Scene

**Note**: Since pymol interpolates between scenes a final "empty" scene is required. In this scene you are only required to define object state and frame (ie. the final frame of the movie).

| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `scene`   | Scene name. (The example uses a number but this is not required. Scenes are loaded and linked in the order they appear in the .yaml) |
| `frame`   | Starting frame for the scene.                                                                                                        |
| `objects` | List of objets in the scene configuration.                                                                                           |
| `camera`  | Camera movement configuration.                                                                                                       |

A sample scene:

```yaml
scenes:
  - scene: 1
    frame: 1
    objects:
      - ...
    camera:
      - ...
```

#### scenes:objects

|           |                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`    | Pymol editor name for object.                      |
| `states`  | State of object in this scene.                     |
| `actions` | List of actions to perform on object in this scene |

A sample object:

```yaml
scenes:
  - scene: 1
    frame: 1
    objects:
      - name: isaac
        state: 1
        actions:
          - ...
    camera:
      - ...
```

#### scenes:objects:actions

All objects in pymol are defined in the Cartesian coordinate system called the model space. Changing
the coordinates in model space is only necessary when objects must be moved relative to each other.

To add additional options to the ones defined below, only `MovieMaker._setup_model` method needs to
be changed. This is done by adding a branch to the else statement with the required `choice` string
and then using the pymol api to define the action(s) required.

|                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `translate`      | `selection` selection of the object, `vector` vector to translate. Written in the form `[0,0,0]`. https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Translate                                                                    |
| `rotate`         | `selection` selection of the object, `axis` axis to perform rotation, `angle` rotation in degrees, maximum rotation of 180. https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Rotate                                             |
| `representation` | `selection` selection of the object, `representation` the representation. https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Show_as                                                                                              |
| `color`          | `selection` selection of the object, `color` the color. https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Color                                                                                                                  |
| `surface_sticks` | `selection` selection of the object. This is a preset and is not in the standard pymol api. This action changes the representation of the object to be shown as both surface and sticks with an opacity of 0.5 |

A sample action:

```yaml
scenes:
  - scene: 1
    frame: 1
    objects:
      - name: isaac
        state: 1
        actions:
          - translate:
              selection: chain A
              vector: [1, 0, 0]
          - rotate:
              selection: chain C
              axis: x
              angle: 90
          - representation:
              selection: all
              representation: cartoon
          - color:
              selection: all
              color: red
          - surface_sticks:
              selection: chain C
    camera:
      - ...
```

#### scenes:camera

The pymol camera uses camera space to define object movement relative to the camera. When the camera
is initially loaded the model axes correspond to the physical directions of the screen: x and y are
horizontal and vertical, z is perpendicular to the screen. When the camera is moved this is no
longer true for the model space axis, however, remains true for camera space axis.

To add additional options to the ones defined below, only `MovieMaker._setup_camera` method needs to
be changed. This is done by adding a branch to the else statement with the required `choice` string
and then using the pymol api to define the action(s) required.

| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `move`   | `axis` axis to perform movement, `magnitude` float of magnitude of movement. https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Move |
| `turn`   | `axis` axis to perform rotation, `angle` rotation in degrees. https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Turn                |
| `zoom`   | `selection` zoom selection. https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Zoom                                                  |
